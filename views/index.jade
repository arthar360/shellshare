    h2 Frequently asked questions
    h3 Can I save the broadcast?
    p.
      No. Shellshare was made only for live broadcasts. If you'd like to save your terminal, try
      <a href="https://asciinema.org">asciinema.org</a>.
    h3 Can I broadcast to a friendlier link?
    p
      | Yes. You can broadcast to a named room secured with a password by calling shellshare as:
      pre
        code.
          $ wget -qO shellshare http://get.shellshare.net
          $ python shellshare --room MY-ROOM --password MY-PASS
          <span class="shell-output">Sharing terminal in http://www.shellshare.net/r/MY-ROOM</span>
          $ # ...
          $ exit
          <span class="shell-output">End of transmission.</span>
      | Keep in mind that the rooms are deleted when they have no activity for more than a day.
